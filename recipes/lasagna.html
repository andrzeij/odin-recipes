      Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved
      foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just
      something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of
      of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort
      of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep
      digging in until you burst.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>The Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Onion, garlic, carrot and celery - for the flavour base, a
        <em>soffrito</em>
      </li>
      <li>Beef</li>
      <li>Canned tomato and tomato paste</li>
      <li>Red wine - for extra flavour</li>
      <li>
        Seasonings - beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme,
        oregano, Worcestershine sauce
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The White Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Nutmeg</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For assembling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lasagna sheet - preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery
        stores) but dried works just fine too
      </li>
      <li>Cheese!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>The Bolognese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Saute garlic and onion - about 3 minutes</li>
      <li>Brown the beef - about 2 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Add everything else, give it a good stir then simmer for 20 minutes
        minimum (midweek), up to 3 hours (weekend indulgence!). Slow cooking
        makes the beef incredibly tender and the sauce develops extra flavour.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The White Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix butter, flour and cheese in a sauce pan</li>
      <li>Stir and add milk</li>
      <li>Add nutmeg and salt</li>
      <li>Continue stir for 8 minutes</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Layering it up</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Smear</strong> a bit of meat sauce on the base first - stops the
        lasagna sheets from sliding around
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer 1</strong> - top with meat sauce, bit of white sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer 2</strong> - lay out more lasagna sheets, then top with
        more meat sauce and more white sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer 3</strong> - repeat again, lasagna sheets, meat sauce then
        white sauce; and
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Topping</strong> - cover with lasagna sheets, pour over
        remaining white sauce then sprinkle with cheese.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pop it in the oven for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Take out from the oven and it is ready to serve!</li>
    </ol>
