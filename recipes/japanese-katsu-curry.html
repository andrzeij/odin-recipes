    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Japanese Chicken Katsu Curry Rice is our new favorite recipe of the
      moment! It’s a symphony of textures—crispy panko-breaded chicken cutlet,
      creamy curry sauce, and slightly sticky, beautifully translucent Japanese
      rice. What more could you ask from a meal?
    </p>

      <li>1 carrot</li>
      <li>800ml water</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>80g panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>4 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>400g cooked japanese rice</li>
      <li>tonkatsu sauce</li>
      <li>fukujinzuke pickled radish</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cut the vegetables into chunks:</strong> Cut 1 large onion 1
        large, potato and 1 carrot into small chunks before adding them to a
        large pan half filled with water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Bring the water to boil and then simmer
        for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. It is a good idea to
        start cooking your rice now.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the curry roux:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat.
        Add 4-5 blocks of curry roux to the pot with vegetables. Turn on the
        heat to low and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. Keep mixing until the
        curry sauce is thick and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the chicken katsu:</strong> While the curry is infusing,
        season your chicken breast pieces with salt and pepper before covering
        with flour first and then raw egg, then panko breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deep fry the chicken katsu:</strong> Heat up the oil in a
        separate saucepan to 180°C and carefully lower the cutlets into the oil
        and cook them for a few minutes on both sides until they become a golden
        brown colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish and enjoy:</strong> Slice the cooked chicken katsu into
        strips and lay over a bed of rice before adding the curry sauce. Garnish
        with fukujinzuke pickled radish, tonkatsu sauce, and boiled egg halves.
        Enjoy.
