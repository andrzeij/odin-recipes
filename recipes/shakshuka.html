    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Shakshuka</strong> is an easy, healthy meal in Israel and other
      parts of the Middle East and North Africa. It's a simple combination of
      simmering tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices and gently poached eggs. It's
      nourishing, filling and one recipe I guarantee you'll make time and again.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetables:</strong> The base of shakshuka is a mix of sauteed
        onion, bell pepper, and garlic, along with tomatoes (I use a can of
        whole peeled tomatoes).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices:</strong> The simple combination of paprika, cumin, and
        chili powder imparts incredible flavor. And the aroma instantly takes me
        back to meandering the spice souks in Cairo and Amman.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> The eggs gently poach in the spiced tomato
        mixture. You can cook them as long as youâ€™d like for your perfect yolk
        texture. I personally prefer my yolks a bit runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fresh Herbs:</strong> A sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley and
        cilantro not only adds a pop of green, but also adds yet another layer
        of flavor.
      </li>
    </ul>
